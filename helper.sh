##DOCUMENTATION
##  This file is here to help people easily run just one component of the megascript in
##  their own setups (or even other projects! Just make sure to credit us somewhere).
##  To run, let's say, the joycon-mouse file from this repository, which is in the 'scripts' folder, you
##  would run the following line (without the hashtags or empty space in front):
##        bash <( curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobalt2727/L4T-Megascript/master/helper.sh ) "scripts/joycon-mouse.sh"

##  Since barrier.sh is in another subfolder, to run that, you'd do something like:
##        bash <( curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobalt2727/L4T-Megascript/master/helper.sh ) "scripts/extras/barrier.sh"

##  And obviously you need both bash and curl installed for these to work - the scripts should in most cases install everything else themselves.
